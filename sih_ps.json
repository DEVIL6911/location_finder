Many farmers also don’t maintain records of their activities, which limits learning from past seasons and accessing scheme benefits. Challenge Build an AI-powered personal farming assistant that acts like a digital companion for each farmer—understanding their specific context, guiding their actions, and learning over time. Core Features 1. Farmer & Farm Profiling: Capture key details—location, land size, crop, soil type, irrigation. 2. Conversational Interface: Enable farmers to interact in Malayalam via voice or text. 3. Activity Tracking: Let farmers log events like sowing, irrigation, input use, or pest issues in simple language. 4. Personalized Advisory: Use AI to give proactive, contextual guidance—e.g., “Rain expected, avoid spraying tomorrow,” or “Pest outbreak reported nearby—inspect your brinjal crop.” 5. Reminders & Alerts: Send timely nudges for crop operations, scheme deadlines, and price trends. 6. Knowledge Engine: Pull from local crop calendars, pest data, and best practices to continuously improve recommendations. Expected Impact - Empowers farmers with personalized, on-demand support. - Enhances productivity and sustainability through timely actions. - Bridges the knowledge gap using AI + local context. This solution aims to create a “Krishi Sakhi”—a digital friend who walks with the farmer throughout the crop cycle. The fund availability is subject to availability through government sanction."

Traditional training methods often fail to inspire lasting behavioural change, especially among younger farmers. Challenge Design a gamified digital platform that educates and motivates farmers to adopt sustainable agricultural practices through interactive challenges, rewards, and community participation. Core Features - Learning Through Play: Convert best practices—such as organic input use, mixed cropping, soil health management—into engaging missions or tasks. - Personalized Quests: Tailor challenges based on the farmer’s crop, location, and farm size—e.g., “Complete 3 weeks of mulching on banana fields” or “Switch to bio-pesticides this season.” - Progress Tracker: Visual dashboards showing farmer progress, sustainability score, and learning badges. - Peer Sharing & Leaderboards: Allow farmers to share progress and earn recognition locally or panchayat-wise. - Incentive System: Link rewards to real-world benefits like scheme eligibility points, training credits, or public recognition. Expected Impact - Encourages adoption of eco-friendly practices in a fun, engaging way. - Builds a digitally connected community of progressive farmers. - Makes sustainable farming accessible, especially for youth and early adopters.

Core Features - Natural Language Query Handling: Farmers can ask questions via voice or text in Malayalam—e.g., “Which pesticide for leaf spot in my banana?” - Multimodal Inputs: Support for image uploads (e.g., diseased crop photo) or voice notes. - AI-Powered Knowledge Engine: Use LLMs and fine-tuned agri datasets to provide reliable, tailored answers—drawing from local crop calendars, pest advisories, weather, and scheme guidelines. - Context Awareness: Factor in the farmer’s location, crop, season, and history (if known) to give personalized advice. - Escalation System: For complex or unclear queries, escalate to local agri officers with context and suggestions. - Learning Loop: Continuously improve the system using real queries, feedback, and local expert inputs. Expected Impact - Makes expert-level farming advice instantly accessible to all. - Bridges the communication gap between farmers and extension systems. - Supports Krishibhavans and Agri Departments by automating first-level support. This system aims to become a “Digital Krishi Officer”—always available, always learning, and always farmer-first."

However, there is a major gap in the availability, accessibility, and stigma-free delivery of mental health support in most higher education institutions, especially in rural and semi-urban colleges. Problem Faced: - Absence of a structured, scalable, and stigma-free psychological intervention system. - Lack of early detection and preventive mental health tools. - Under-utilization of college counselling centres due to fear of judgment or lack of awareness. - No centralized mental health monitoring or data-driven policy framework within institutions. Proposed Technological Challenge: Develop a Digital Psychological Intervention System (web-based and\/or mobile app) with the following capabilities: 1. \nAI-guided First-Aid Support: Interactive chat box that offers coping strategies and refers students to professionals when needed. 2. \nConfidential Booking System: For appointment with on-campus counsellor or mental health helpline. 3. \nPsychoeducational Resource Hub: Videos, relaxation audio, mental wellness guides in regional languages. 4. \nPeer Support Platform: Moderated peer-to-peer support forum with trained student volunteers. 5. \nAdmin Dashboard: Anonymous data analytics for authorities to recognize trends and plan interventions.

    "description":"ID 25100 Problem Statement Title Accelerating High-Fidelity Road Network Modeling for Indian Traffic\nSimulations. Description Urban traffic congestion in Indian cities is worsened by the limitations of current urban planning software, which often assumes ideal, well-maintained road conditions typical of developed countries. Such software fails to account for the unpredictable and nuanced realities of Indian roads—such as potholes, temporary barricades, partial lane closures, construction activities, and erratic driver behaviors. Manually modeling these complex and dynamic road features into digital twins for realistic traffic simulations is both tedious and time-consuming, often requiring significant engineering effort before any meaningful simulation can be conducted. To address this challenge, MathWorks is seeking innovative solutions to accelerate the creation of highly detailed digital twins of existing Indian road junctions and networks. The aim is to design toolsets, templates, asset libraries, or workflows—leveraging MATLAB, Simulink, Automated Driving Toolbox, RoadRunner, and potentially generative AI—that significantly streamline the process. The solution should enable users to easily incorporate typical Indian road features and simulate hyper-local vehicular behaviors in their modeling, thereby empowering traffic management agencies to run realistic simulations for crisis handling, congestion management, and infrastructure planning. Proposals should focus on enhancing the modeling process rather than traffic optimization and must integrate seamlessly with MATLAB-based simulation workflows.

    "description":"ID 25108 Problem Statement Title Development of AI-powered FRA Atlas and WebGIS-based Decision Support System (DSS) for Integrated Monitoring of Forest Rights Act (FRA) Implementation.\r (States to be concentrated: Madhya Pradesh, Tripura , Odisha, Telangana) Description Problem Background : The Forest Rights Act (FRA), 2006 recognizes the rights of forest-dwelling communities over land and forest resources. However, significant challenges persist: • Legacy records of Individual Forest Rights (IFR), Community Rights (CR), and Community Forest Resource Rights (CFR) are scattered, non-digitized, and difficult to verify. • There is no centralized, real-time visual repository (e.g., an FRA Atlas) of FRA claims and granted titles. • Integration of satellite-based asset mapping (land, water bodies, farms, etc.) with FRA data is missing. • Integration of legacy data with FRA Atlas is missing. • Decision-makers lack a Decision Support System (DSS) to layer Central Sector Schemes (CSS) benefits (e.g., PM-KISAN, Jal Jeevan Mission, MGNREGA, DAJGUA (3 ministries)) for FRA patta holders. Project Objectives 1. Digitize and standardize legacy data of FRA claims, verifications, and pattas, and integrate with FRA Atlas. FRA patta holders’ shapefiles to be integrated. 2. Create an FRA Atlas showing potential and granted FRA areas using AI and satellite data. 3. Integrate a WebGIS portal to visualize and manage spatial and socio-economic data. 4. Use Remote Sensing and AI\/ML to map capital and social assets (ponds, farms, forest resources) of FRA-holding villages. 5. Build a Decision Support System (DSS) to recommend and layer CSS schemes based on mapped data, enhancing targeted development. AI & Tech Components 1. Data Digitization • Use suitable models to extract and standardize text from scanned FRA documents. • Apply Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify village names, patta holders, coordinates, and claim status. 2. AI-based Asset Mapping • Employ Computer Vision on high-resolution satellite imagery to detect: • Agricultural land • Forest cover • Water bodies (ponds, streams) • Homesteads • Classify land-use using supervised ML models (e.g., Random Forest, CNN). • Add layers of information with respect to forest data, groundwater data, and infrastructure data (e.g., PM Gati Shakti). 3. WebGIS Integration • Interactive layers (IFR\/CR, village boundaries, land-use, assets) • Filters by state\/district\/village\/tribal group • FRA progress tracking (village\/block\/district\/state level) 4. Decision Support System (DSS) • Build a rule-based + AI-enhanced DSS engine that: • Cross-links FRA holders with eligibility for CSS schemes such as DAJGUA and others. • Prioritizes interventions (e.g., borewells under Jal Shakti for villages with low water index). Deliverables 1. AI-processed digital archive of FRA claims & decisions. 2. An interactive FRA Atlas on a WebGIS platform. 3. AI-generated asset maps for all FRA villages. 4. A DSS engine for scheme layering and policy formulation. Target Users • Ministry of Tribal Affairs • District-level Tribal Welfare Departments & Line Departments of DAJGUA • Forest and Revenue Departments • Planning & Development Authorities • NGOs working with tribal communities Future Scope • Incorporate real-time satellite feeds for monitoring CFR forests. • Integrate IoT sensors for soil health, water quality, etc., in FRA lands (if feasible). • Enable mobile-based feedback and updates from patta holders themselves."
